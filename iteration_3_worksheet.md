# Iteration 3 Worksheet
## What technical debt has been cleaned up?
**Show links to a commit where you paid off technical debt. Write 2-5 sentences that explain what debt was paid, and what its classification is.**

- [Commit: 0a2132ab](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a03/winnipeg-sports-app-a03-group-6/-/commit/0a2132ab7a0e0231c8727ed5a8410b87ba7fd1c7)

In these two commits we are adjusting our menu, increasing its flexibility and greatly reducing the amount of code. We were fixing a violation of the open-closed principle from iteration 2. Our previous design was poor because in order to add new features to our menu activity we would have to copy and paste a few different times, not being open to adding functionality (something we knew in advance we would be doing). Having spent 1-2 hours reworking the layout was the payment of the debt. I would classify this debt as inadvertent/prudent as we now know how we should have designed the menu class, while using a less sophisticated version was necessary to get our app running when we had fewer features.

## What technical debt did you leave?
**What one item would you like to fix and canâ€™t? Anything you write will not be marked negatively. Classify this debt.**

Given the features we chose to implement for our app, we are displaying a lot of sports data. Android studio provides a great way to implement lists with the recycler view, which you can extend to create your own custom recycler view. Most of our features in one way or another use a recycler view, and so we ended up with a lot of implementations. While some are necessarily distinct, as we got more comfortable with android studio we started reusing assets more. Now looking back at some of our features, we could have reused a few recycler view adapters had we designed them to be more flexible. While creating another adapter seemed the easier path at the start of the project, reuse of our recycler views is better design and less code duplication. I would classify this as somewhere between inadvertent reckless and prudent favoring prudent, as our app still behaves as we intended but probably uses more code than necessary.

## Discuss a feature or user story that was cut/re-prioritized
**When did you change the priority of a feature or user story? Why was it re-prioritized? Provide a link to the feature or user story. This can be from any iteration.**

We changed the priority of the [Track Live Game feature](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a03/winnipeg-sports-app-a03-group-6/-/issues/5) at the end of iteration 1, from high priority to medium priority. It was re-prioritized because we had not done enough research to integrate the live data into our application by using an API in iteration 1, thus we re-prioritized and move the feature to the subsequent iteration.

## Acceptance test/end-to-end
**Write a discussion about an end-to-end test that you wrote. What did you test, how did you set up the test so it was not flaky? Provide a link to that test.**

- [ChannelsTest](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a03/winnipeg-sports-app-a03-group-6/-/blob/Develop/app/src/androidTest/java/comp3350/winSport/ChannelsTest.java)

ChannelsTest tests our [channel feature](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a03/winnipeg-sports-app-a03-group-6/-/issues/11), in which where users are able to access resources [to where they can watch a game live](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a03/winnipeg-sports-app-a03-group-6/-/issues/45). Clicking on one of the channels on the list, opens the device's web browser and redirects into a webpage. Since this the primary action sequence of this feature, testing the ability to select a channel from the list and sending activity to the browser is critical. This sequence is tested in two ways: `testIntentBrowser()`, and `viewChannel()`. 

`testIntentBrowser()` uses stubbing via Espresso-intents, which checks whether the intent to open the browser was sent. Using intents is similar to using Mockito, so this is just testing that the intended behaviour -- which is sending the activity to browser -- is actually happening. `viewChannel()` works similar to `testIntentBrowser()`, but instead of just checking behaviour, it actually opens the browser and the website will be loaded as programmed. To prevent "flakiness", this feature was tested with redundancy through mocking via Espresso-intents, as well as activating the feature in real-time. This ensures the correctness of the logic, with then guarantees that the feature is behaving as intended. Checks using `matches(isDisplayed())` is also used to make sure the correct views are present during the execution of the test. 

## Acceptance test, untestable
**What challenges did you face when creating acceptance tests? What was difficult or impossible to test?**

Because of how we implemented certain features, it was difficult to fully test certain functionalities. For example, in [NewsFeedTest](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a03/winnipeg-sports-app-a03-group-6/-/blob/Develop/app/src/androidTest/java/comp3350/winSport/NewsFeedTest.java), the comment buttons all have the same id, which leads to a `AmbiguousViewMatcherException` error. While the adding comments in the app definitely works, implementing the acceptance test is difficult to test and was ultimately ommitted from testing. Maybe, given more time and experience with Espresso, there is a solution to this. But for now, the testing for commenting will remain shallow. 


## Velocity/teamwork
Did your estimates get better or worse through the course? Show some evidence of the estimates/actuals from tasks.

Yes, our estimates got better through the course. At the beginning of iteration 1, we committed to more features than we can complete. We were able to complete more work in iteration 2 and we completed all planned work for iteration 3.
