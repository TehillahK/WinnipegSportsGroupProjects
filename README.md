### Vision Statement

**What is the Winnipeg Sports App?**

The Winnipeg Sports App will be designed for sports fans who wish to keep up with Winnipeg sports teams by tracking live updates. Our application will enable the users to stay up-to-date with their local favorite teams like the Winnipeg Jets, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Manitoba Moose, Valour FC, and more. In our application, fans can find information about the previously played and upcoming games and television channels enabling them to watch the live games. Furthermore, the live game tracking feature will inform the users about the stadium venues, bars, restaurants showing the games as well as receive real-time notifications for live score updates. Lastly, our application will allow the users to see their team rosters and current lineup with points updates.

**Who is Winnipeg Sports App for?**

Our application will serve as a platform for entertainment and social networking and it will benefit fans who love watching Winnipeg sports. It will also enable sports fans to engage in conversations about live games and banter. Unlike other applications, which tend to focus more on their specific sports type, our application is designed more for every sports fan in Winnipeg. To add to this, each ongoing game will have a live chat component where they can connect, socialize, and talk about the game in-depth.

**Why is Winnipeg Sports App valuable?**

Our application hopes to serve those who wish to find more information about the ongoing game without needing to have several internet pages open. The live chat will also provide critical and live updates on-the-go to those who may not be able to watch the game. By having a live chat component as well as a bar and restaurant locator, our application will serve as an opportunity to connect local sports fans whether they gather in the live chat or at a bar or restaurant. Our application will be something people who used to live in Winnipeg can find useful, and a way for them to connect with others back home. In this present time during the pandemic and public restrictions, we hope that our application’s live chat component can be something our users will look forward to.

We believe Winnipeg Sports App is valuable because it gives local sports fans an easier way to access all Winnipeg-related sports. Users won’t need outside sources with ourapplication providing everything from nearby locations for bars and restaurants, live updates and even a place to chat with others about the games. We also hope that our application is something that they can enjoy before and after the lockdown and the public restriction end. Finally, social gatherings via live chat will allow current and former Winnipeggers to stay in touch by talking about the sport they love.

**How will Winnipeg Sports App be successful?**

The application is considered a success based on three criteria. First, we want a million users worldwide in the first year that the application becomes available 
to users and generate a 10 million dollars revenue within the same year. Secondly, we intend on receiving feedback from users who will complete a digital survey and compare their ease of accessing information about Winnipeg sports teams now to how they retrieved such information before our application was available to them. To conclude, we will compare the number of views Winnipeg games have had before and after our application became available to users. If any one of the criteria shows a significant improvement, without a statistically significant reduction in the other two, the application will be considered a success.

## Iteration 1

### Branching Strategy

Our branching strategy is called [git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). We made another branch off the master branch called develop, this is the branch we agree to commit reviewed and approved changes into. Members are to create a unique branch for the part of the feature they are working on, and this how we, as members of the team, will work on each feature implementation. Once a team member is positive with recent changes made on their branch, their branch is then reviewed by the team or a team member. If we are positive it meets the requirements as described in our dev task or user stories, then the team member can create a merge request and merge to develop branch. Once our changes in the develop branch are fully ready for production, then we merge the develop branch to master branch for release.
