## _Vision statement_

The Winnipeg Sports App will be designed for sports fans who wish to keep up with Winnipeg sports teams by tracking live updates. This will enable the users to stay up-to-date with their local favorite teams like the Winnipeg Jets, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Manitoba Moose, Valour FC, and more. In this application, fans can find information about the previously played and upcoming games and television channels enabling them to watch the live games. Furthermore, the live game tracking feature will inform the users about the stadium venues, bars, and restaurants showing the games, as well as receive real-time notifications for live score updates. Lastly, this application will allow the users to see their team rosters and current lineup with points updates.

This application will serve as a platform for entertainment and social networking, and it will benefit fans who love watching Winnipeg sports. It will enable sports fans to engage in conversations about live games and banter. Unlike other applications, which tend to focus more on their specific sports type, this application is designed more for every sports fan in Winnipeg. To add to this, each ongoing game will have a live chat component where they can connect, socialize, and talk about the game in-depth.

Our application hopes to serve those who wish to find more information about the ongoing game, without needing to have several internet pages open. The live chat will also provide critical and live updates on-the-go to those who may not be able to watch the game. By having a live chat component as well as a bar and restaurant locator, our application will serve as an opportunity to connect local sports fans, whether they gather in the live chat or at a bar or restaurant. It will, for sure, be something people who used to live in Winnipeg can find useful, and a way for them to connect with others back home. In this present time during the pandemic and public restrictions, we hope that our applicationâ€™s live chat component can be something our users will look forward to.

We believe Winnipeg Sports App is valuable because it gives local sports fans an easier way to access all Winnipeg-related sports. They won't need to be on several internet pages, searching for bars and restaurants showing the game, or live updates, rosters, and a platform to chat about the games. We hope that our application is something that they can enjoy before and after the lockdown and public restrictions. Social gatherings via live chat will allow current and former Winnipeggers to stay in touch by engaging in sports conversations.

The application is considered a success based on the following criteria. First, we want a million users worldwide in the first year that the application becomes available to users, and generate a 10 million dollars revenue within the same year. Secondly, we intend on receiving feedback from users who will complete a digital survey and compare their ease of accessing information about Winnipeg sports teams now to how they retrieved such information before our application was available to them. To conclude, we will compare the number of views Winnipeg games have had before and after our application became available to users. If any one of the criteria shows a significant improvement, without a statistically significant reduction in the other two, the application will be considered a success.
